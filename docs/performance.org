* TODO Some tests and results
* TODO Client cmdline options
--nosetloader, --nomain, others?
* TODO Reading and passing stdin lines
A test with reading a file, with max-lines parameter versus total running time:

| max-lines | time (s) |
|-----------+----------|
|         1 |     30.6 |
|         2 |     15.5 |
|         3 |     10.5 |
|         5 |      6.5 |
|        10 |      3.5 |
|        20 |      2.1 |
|        50 |     1.11 |
|       100 |     0.84 |
|      1000 |      0.5 |
* Client/daemon communication
Currently TCP socket and bencode are used. Maybe Linux pipes are faster, when available.
* TODO Analysis current 300 msec
A simple scriptrun takes about 300 milliseconds. Check where this time is spent. Some testcases:
- Running genie -h (no communication with server)
- Running genie --list-sessions (no new session, no script and library loading)
* TODO Test memory usage/leaks
Create a script that use a lot of memory. Run it a few times, check memory. Maybe also script that creates a lot of classes, they used to be harder to GC.
